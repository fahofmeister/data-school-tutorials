Just learned that if you press ```tab``` in Jupyter Notebook, a dropdown menu with available methods and properties will pop up. Also, inside the parenthesis of functions, pressing ```Shift + Tab``` will show the docstring. If the keys are pressed a second time, the docstring will remain longer. For third and fourth times, the docstring is expanded.

Resuming the course, I decided to use a single notebook for every 10 videos watched. It was becoming difficult to review past content.
